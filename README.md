## Overview
Software runs on ROS1 Noetic, but could be easily ported to ROS2. All modules are Python3, with minimal C++ to make it easy for hobbyest to use and modify.  See software overview on www.dshinsel.com for more info.

## Dependencies (a work in progress)
- ROS Noetic (or port to your version)
- Arduino IDE for Linux
  - [Arduino Linux Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux)
- Pygame for async music playback
  - sudo -H pip install pygame
    
- I'll add more as I think of it...
