turtlebot_teleop
================

Turtlebot Teleoperation implementation. 
This package used to be in turtlebot_apps repository. It has been temporarily migrated into turtlebot 
because it is useful for both robot(turtlebot_apps) side and user side pc(turtlebot_interactions). 

Attributions: This code was branched from turtlebot, and modified to work standalone from the rest of the turtlebot stack under permission of the BSD license

NOTE: 
EB Robot uses same version of turtlebot_joy.cpp as TB2S
Sheldon Robot uses a modified version that remaps the bottom left switch as a faster deadman switch.
